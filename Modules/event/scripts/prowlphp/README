Hello there! This is a PHP class for Prowls iPhone notificaton service with API key authentication. More information on Prowl can be found at  http://prowl.weks.net/. For more information on the class and the Prowl API take a look at the Wiki page (http://wiki.github.com/Fenric/ProwlPHP).

I'd love to hear your ideas, suggestions and even your uses for ProwlPHP.

Additions by Mario Mueller:
I've found this class via prowl's website and I wanted to integrate it into my projects. I've customized the structure to fit my needs and I'll try to push things back to Fenric as improvement request. This is no "I can do it better" remake, but a refactoring under oop-ish patterns and more extensive use of PHP5's capabilities.

Here are the things I've changed:

* Major rewrite of most functions. cUrl with SSL is still required.
* Splitted ProwlConnector and ProwlMessage to make it more OOP-ish.
* In Fenric's original some things were made 'by hand', I've chagend this to native PHP functions if possible
* Most setters throw exceptions now. Be careful ;)
* One connector instance can send multiple messages, see example.php for details
* Added DocBlock comments
* Added Hungarian-Notation-Style variables
* removed underscores from non-public members and methods (this is PHP4 - old - style)
* changed from private to protected, as there is no need to make them unreachable for child-classes 
* removed closing ?> tags, as they are deprecated on php-only files.
* rewrote example.php
* Added fluent interface for most setters
* Added response class for better reponse handling
